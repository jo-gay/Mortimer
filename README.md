### An app to create countdown timers, with custom notifications while running.

Example: When cooking, I might want a timer to tell me when to take the roast dinner out of the oven. But I also want a
notification 20 minutes beforehand so that I can turn on the sprouts on the stove.

Example: When working from home, I get back and neck pain. I have been advised to take a break every hour. I would like a timer
which notifies me every 60 minutes and can be paused until I start work again.
